## Question

#### Define a function named _recursive_encrypt_ that takes a string input. 
1) _recursive_encrypt_ is encrypts the given string and make it reverse in recursive way. 
2) Encripytion is done with this conversion;

- "A", "a"  1

- "E", "e"  2

- "I", "i"  3

- "O", "o"  4

- "U", "u"  5

- Others will stay same

3) Take a string from user

4) Call the _recursive_encrypt_ method with taken input.

5) Print the result.

### Notes:
- You are not allowed to use replace method of strings.

- Not recursive functions will not accepted. You will get low grades, if you are not implemented in recursive way.

### Input Format

- String

### Constraints

- Length of the input >= 0

### Output Format

- String

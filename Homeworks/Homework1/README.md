## Question 1

 ----
### You will be given a list, assume the list will not be empty, consists of floats. You are required to compute some statistical values according to given definitions and formulas.

- Length: Number of elements in the list: N

- Minimum: Minimum element of the list and its index number.

- Max: Maximum element of the list and its index number.

- Sum: Summation of the list.

- Mean: Mean of the list: 

- Variance: Mean of the list: 
 
### Note:

- Do not forget to count from 0 for index number.

- In the case of multiple maximum/maximum number, smallest index will be accepted.

- Do not use any built-in function like len, mean, etc. otherwise, you will not get any points! The aim is to calculate necessary values by iterating over the list.
 
### Input Format

- Space seperated float values 3.14 2 53 12.2

### Constraints

- -999999999 <= x >= 999999999
- 0 < N <= 50

### Output Format

Sample Input 0
```
3.14 2 53 12.2
```
Sample Output 0
```
4 2.00000 1 53.00000 2 70.34000 17.58500 433.69268
```

## Question 2

 ----
### Binary numbers are used in computer and communications systems. So the conversion is important. In this problem we will focus to this conversions.

### Note: 

- You are not allowed to use built-in functions for conversions!

### Input Format

- mode number

- 0 10

- 1 1010

- mode = 0 ->  Decimal to Binary Conversion

- mode = 1 ->  Binary to Decimal Conversion

### Constraints

- mode ∈ [0,1] 

- number >= 0

### Output Format

Sample Input 0
```
0 10
```
Sample Output 0
```
1010
```
